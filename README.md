| 1 | Health Tracker | Python OOP + Basic Logic | ✅Completed |
| 2 | Study Tracker | File Handling (JSON), OOP, CLI Interaction | ✅Completed |
| 3 | K-Means from Scratch | NumPy, Clustering, Data Science | ✅Completed |
| 4 | Sales Data Analyzer | Pandas Data Cleaning, GroupBy, Aggregation | ✅ Completed |
| 4 | Employee Performance Analyzer | Pandas Advanced Analysis, Correlation, HR Analytics | ✅Completed |
| 5 | Business Sales Analytics Dashboard — Data Visualization | Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn | ✅ Completed |


## 🧠 Skills Covered
- **Python Fundamentals**
