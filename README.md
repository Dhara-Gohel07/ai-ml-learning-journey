# 🚀 AI-ML Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI/ML + Python self-learning journey!  
Each folder represents one day/weekend of my consistent practice and project-based learning.

## 📅 Progress Tracker

| Day | Project Name | Focus Area | Status |
|-----|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Health Tracker | Python OOP + Basic Logic | ✅Completed |
| 2 | Study Tracker | File Handling (JSON), OOP, CLI Interaction | ✅Completed |
| 3 | K-Means from Scratch | NumPy, Clustering, Data Science | ✅Completed |

## 🧠 Skills Covered
- Python Fundamentals
- OOP Concepts
- Data Handling & Logic Building
- NumPy and Math Operations
- Clustering (K-Means)
- Health & Productivity Tools
- AI/ML (coming in later weeks)

---

**Goal:** Build 1 project every 1–2 days to improve logic, problem-solving, and real-world thinking in Python.
