# 🎓 Study Tracker

## 📘 Overview
The **Study Tracker** is a Python project designed to help students manage their daily study routine.  
It allows registration, login, and tracking of daily study sessions — stored in a `.txt` file for record-keeping.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- File handling (read/write)
- OOP (Student class)
- Authentication (login/register)
- Editable subject and class info
- Loops and menu-driven interface

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. New user registers (name, age, class, password).
2. User logs in with name & password.
3. Tracks study details:
   - Subject studied
   - Hours spent
   - Notes/remarks
4. Data saved in `study_log.txt`.

## 💡 Example Use Case
Perfect for students who want to track learning habits and improve consistency.
